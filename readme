Customer Segmentation and Personalization
Description:
Develop a customer segmentation model using unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., K-Means clustering) to identify different customer segments based on purchasing behavior. Create personalized marketing strategies for each segment.

Steps:

Data Collection: Use a dataset containing customer transaction history (e.g., demographics, purchase history, frequency).
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalization).
Feature Engineering: Create features like total spending, frequency of purchases, average transaction value, etc.
Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify customer segments.
Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each segment and provide insights.
Personalization Strategy: Develop personalized marketing strategies for each segment.
Visualization: Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizing the clusters and insights.
Documentation: Provide detailed documentation on the process, findings, and recommendations.
